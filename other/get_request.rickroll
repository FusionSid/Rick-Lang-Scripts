take me to ur heart
    # Same as `import requests` in python
    we know the requests and we're gonna play it

    # The link
    give link up "https://fusionsidapi.herokuapp.com/api/fact/"

    # Makes a get request and save the json result to a variable called `response`
    give response up requests.get(link).json()

    # Prints a fact
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling response["fact"] + "\n"
say goodbye
