## Printing:

I rickroll-lang to print to the console you use `i just wanna tell u how im feeling <stuff>`

You can print variables, run functions and even do formatted strings in that line

### Example:
You already know how to print hello world but what about to say hi to someone 

Here are some examples
```py
take me to ur heart
    give name up "Rick Astley" # The name variable

    # Normal print using +
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling "Hello " + name + "\n" 
    
     # print using commas
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling "Hello", name, "\n"
    
    # using the format function
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling "Hello {}\n".format(name) 
    
    # formatted string (f strings)
    i just wanna tell u how im feeling f"Hello {name}\n" 
say goodbye
```

### Output:
```bash
Hello Rick Astley
Hello Rick Astley 
Hello Rick Astley
Hello Rick Astley
```

All of these will achieve the same output.  
Personaly I prefer f strings but you can do whatever you like :)
